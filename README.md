# 📝 Task Manager API

A simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express that allows you to manage a list of tasks stored in a JSON file.

## 📦 Overview

This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing tasks. Tasks include properties like `id`, `title`, `description`, and `completed` status. The data is stored in a local `task.json` file.

Useful for learning Node.js basics like:

- File I/O with `fs`
- RESTful API creation with Express
- Middleware for JSON parsing
- Basic validation and error handling
